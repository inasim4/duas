# KFGQPC Uthmanic Hafs Font

This application uses the KFGQPC Uthmanic Hafs V4 font for Arabic text display. Due to licensing requirements, you'll need to:

1. Download the font from the King Fahad Glorious Quran Printing Complex (KFGQPC) website
2. Place the font files in this directory:
   - `UthmanicHafs.otf` - Regular weight
   - `UthmanicHafs-Bold.otf` - Bold weight (if available)

The font provides excellent readability and proper Tajweed marks for Quranic text. Both OTF and TTF formats are supported, with OTF being preferred for better rendering and OpenType features.
